----------------------------------------------------------
### Actions and follow-up

* Arrange for printouts of standard cheatsheet ("Wikidata in
  brief") as hand-out?

* Andra to ask Lea: what if we exceed IP limits.

----------------------------------------------------------
### Tutorial description

https://hackmd.io/p3XVfm5GRGilacn7yS00-A?both (migrated from [Google doc](http://bit.ly/dc2019_wikidata_tutorial)).

* Paul will put a link to this description from the [DC-2019 Abstract page](https://www.dublincore.org/conferences/2019/abstracts/#29_a) and from the [Programme page](https://www.dublincore.org/conferences/2019/programme/).
* As an experiment, I have linked the [tutorial description](https://hackmd.io/p3XVfm5GRGilacn7yS00-A?both) to a [document on a DCMI Github repo](https://github.com/dcmi/hackday/blob/master/2019-09-25.dc2019_wikidata_tutorial.md).

----------------------------------------------------------
### Session 1: Introduction to Wikidata (90 minutes, 9:00-10:30)

9:00-9:15 (15m)

* Welcome and Introductions
* Does everyone have an account?

9:15-10:00 (45m)

* Tom to provide basic introduction, drawing fairly extensively on [Andrew Lih's slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1erJU5WiEnIGMVF_VRSJ9P6kit1iPuQMmaJ8j6817g5k/edit).

10:00-10:30 (30m)

* Break up into groups.
* Hands-on exercise: "Create WD items for [DC conferences](https://www.dublincore.org/conferences/)"
    * Andra to explain model for describing conferences (which properties to use).
    * Tom, Andra, Joachim help the groups complete the task.
* Show results in Scholia (see [SWAT4LS example](https://hackmd.io/rCpLTaFBSiCjTP6axTnNIA).)
* Plan B could be to work with WikiShootMe that points to local Wikidata points [in the proximity of the venue](https://tools.wmflabs.org/wikishootme/#lat=37.49321046900769&lng=126.98825273662807&zoom=14).

----------------------------------------------------------
### Session 2: Wikidata as a hub for the Linked Data cloud

11:00-12:30
* Andra presentation of [more advanced examples](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_yCelAd4imWyss6OT0kpUHsY4Z9sOBvoLlKRY88nnD0/edit)
    * Does the title of the session still fit the message?
* Possibly, use of Jupyter Notebook?
* Time for hands-on??

----------------------------------------------------------
### Session 3: Applications based on Wikidata

13:00-14:30
* Joachim (and Andra?) present case of newspapers
* "Andra will make a [Jupyter Notebook in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QgHrzwPgGOTUnbhDCG9r_JjPEJxErLv0) that people tweak to add an item."
  * Joachim's reservations: people without programming and in particular Python skills may "adapt" the examples to something which may possibly do harm to the data.
* Chlambase and Scholia as user-friendly interfaces to WD - creating items in a guided way. 
* Integration of Wikidata into existing workflows using things like CSV (see coli-conc project?)
* Hands-on exercise involving newspapers?

----------------------------------------------------------
### Session 4: Wikidata usage scenarios

* Address the perception that Wikidata is completely uncontrolled.
* Andra: how gene wiki uses shape expressions as a contract that will be managed by bot, and the bot used to manage changes.
* Short presentation of OpenRefine?
* What skills an organization needs to get started.  When are coding skills necessary (e.g., Quick Statements)?
* Wikibase and federated queries (and their significance)?
* Wikidata as a primary source?

--------------------------------------------------------- 
### Next steps
* Teleconference in week of September 9-13 - see [Doodle poll](https://doodle.com/poll/nq6q3rffif5pe3ps)
* Upload slides by Wednesday, September 18:
    * Convert all slides into PDF for posting on dublincore.org and linking to the conference program
